# Websites

The web is made up of 4 primary "languages."

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (not covered in this course)
- Web Assembly (not covered in this course)

## HTML

## CSS

## JavaScript

## Web Assembly

Web Assembly (WASM) allows languages other than JS to be used in the web.

JavaScript, as well as other interpreted languages (such as python) are known for being quite slow, since they have to be Just In Time (JIT) compiled.
This compilation time decreases the speed of the language.
