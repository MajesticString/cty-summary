# Other Information

## Interpreted Languages

Interpreted languages are programming languages that are _directly interpreted_ and _not compiled_.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is an interpreted language since it is interpreted by the browser without being compiled

### Java

Java is both an interpreted and compiled language.
It is compiled into `class` files, which are then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine.
This allows any Java program to be run on any computer with the Java runtime installed.
