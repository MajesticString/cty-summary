# Other Information

## Interpreted Languages

Interpreted languages are programming languages that are _directly interpreted_ and _not compiled_.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is an interpreted language since it is interpreted by the browser without being compiled

### Java

Java is both an interpreted and compiled language.
It is compiled into `class` files, which are then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine.
This allows any Java program to be run on any computer with the Java runtime installed.

## Compile Targets

Compile targets are places that compiled languages (such as Rust) can be compiled to.
For example, if a compile target is Windows, a `.exe` file will be generated.
Whereas if a compile target was MacOS, a `.dmg` file will be generated.
